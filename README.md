- (Deep learning.ai) - (Machine Learning Specialization) - (Instructor: Andrew NJ) - (University: Stanford) - (Platform: Coursera)

- The specialization consists of 3 courses and this repository contains my implementation for all the tasks and projects I did throughout the specialization.

- Course 1: (Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification)

- Project 1: Profit Analysis and City Selection for Restaurant Expansion (C1-W2 Single-Var Lin-Reg-Practice): 
  Linear regression with 1 variable.
  

- Project 2: University admission filtering (C1_W3_Logistic_Regression):
