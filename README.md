Machine Learning Specialization by Deep Learning AI
This repository serves as proof of my work on the Machine Learning Specialization offered by Deep Learning AI on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng. It contains the graded practical tasks and certificates for each course completed.

Specialization Overview
The Machine Learning Specialization covers various aspects of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and practical applications. The specialization consists of the following courses:

Course 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
Course 2: Supervised Learning Techniques
Course 3: Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction
Repository Structure
This repository is organized into separate folders, each corresponding to a course in the specialization. Inside each course folder, you will find the graded practical tasks that I completed along with any necessary resources or datasets.

Practical Task Completion
I have completed the practical tasks for each course in the specialization. The task folders contain my implementations, which were graded based on correctness, efficiency, and code quality.

Certificates
I have earned certificates for completing each course in the Machine Learning Specialization. You can find the certificates in the "Certificates" folder of this repository. Here are the direct links to download the certificates:

Course 1 Certificate
Course 2 Certificate
Course 3 Certificate
